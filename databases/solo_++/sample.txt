Gabriel Robins|The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.
Muhammad Ali|Last week I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick. I am so mean I make medicine sick.
Muhammad Ali|Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. The hands cant hit what the eyes cant see.
Muhammad Ali|Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world theyve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. Its an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. Its a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.
