given: a spy's real name
when: we have the spy's first and last name
then we will swap the first and last name using split on spaces

given swapped names (last and first) 
when they are elements in an array
then we will join them back together using join

given one joined string of last and first names separated by a space
when we want to encode the vowels 
then we will set up an array: only_vowels
then we will iterate over the vowels in the names charified array
  when we encounter a vowel in our names charified array
  then we will replace it with  the next vowel in the array
