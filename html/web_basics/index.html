    <h1>Unlearn!</h1>
    <p>Unlearn is a philosophy that is <strong>embraced</strong> by the Maker Community. This can be demonstrated in several <em>crazy</em> projects including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxxPyaAT1k">Homemade Hoverbike</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXWspo5hrc">Jet Kart</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>Top reasons why you should not build any of the projects listed above:
      <ol>
        <li>
          It will scare your mother!
        </li>
        <li>
          40 million people will see the video of your death if something goes horribly-wrong.
        </li>
        <li>
          Auto-manufacturers will put a contract out on you if Hover-bike takes off!
        </li>
      </ol>
